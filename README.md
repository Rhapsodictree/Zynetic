# Zynetic Product Catalog App

Hey there! This is my Zynetic Product Catalog App, a cool project I built for the coding assignment for zynetic.

## Overview

This app is all about exploring products! When you open it, youâ€™ll see a list of items with their names, short descriptions, and pictures. If something catches your eye, just tap it, and youâ€™ll go to a new screen with more details like more images, the price, category, and even a rating. Itâ€™s like shopping online but simpler and made by me!

## Features

- **Product List**: Starts with a scrollable list of products you can check out right away.
- **Product Details**: Tap a product to see a fancy gallery of images, the full description (twice for fun!), price, category, and a star rating.
- **Loading Fun**: While the app grabs data from the internet, youâ€™ll see a cool spinning circle.
- **Error Handling**: If something goes wrong (like no internet), it shows an error message with a retry buttonâ€”super helpful!
- **Pretty Design**: The app looks nice with cards, images, and a smooth navigation between screens.

## How to Set It Up

1. **Get the Code**: Download the `.zip` file or clone the GitHub repo (if I share a link!).
2. **Open in Android Studio**: Use the latest version of Android Studio to open the project.
3. **Connect to Internet**: Make sure your computer or phone is online since the app pulls data from the web.
4. **Run It**: Hit the "Run" button, and it should work on your Android device or emulator!

## Tech I Used

- **Language**: I used Kotlin, which is super fun and modern for app development.
- **UI Design**: Made it with Jetpack Compose, a cool way to create screens that look great.
- **Structure**: Followed something called MVVM and Clean Architecture to keep everything organized (learned this in class!).
- **Data Fetching**: Used Ktor to grab product info from a test website (https://dummyjson.com).
- **Navigation**: Added smooth screen changes with Voyager.
- **Extras**: Included Koin for managing parts of the app and some image-loading magic with a library.

## Notes

- I kept it simple but tried to make it look good and work well.
- The app needs internet to show products, so it might not work offline (yet!).
- I focused on making it easy to use and pretty, like a real app!

## Bonus Stuff

- Added loading indicators and retry options when things go wrongâ€”pretty proud of that!
- The UI is responsive, so it should look nice on different phone sizes.

## Thanks!

Thanks for checking out my app! I had a blast making it and learning new things. If you have any feedback, Iâ€™d love to hear it. Good luck to me on this assignmentâ€”hope it stands out! ðŸ˜„
